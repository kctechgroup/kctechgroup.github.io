    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The growing season has been a little late this year and it feels a bit like we may have skipped Spring straight over to Summer üî• here in Kansas, but I think I‚Äôm happier with the cold having moved on.  The wind has also calmed itself more lately.  However, since I can‚Äôt resist a good pun, the winds of change are still strong at work and that certainly helps us consider new and improved ways of deploying some of our applications!  &lt;‚Äì Great segway, yeah?  üòÜ ü§ì</p><a id="more"></a><p>The topic for June‚Äôs Meeting of the Minds session is Heroku, and yours truly will be doing the presentation.  I‚Äôve been intrigued by <a href="https://www.heroku.com" title="Heroku" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heroku</a> and its offerings since I became enamoured with container computing more than a year ago.  Lately I‚Äôve actually been putting it to good use deploying some <a href="https://www.mkdocs.org" title="MkDocs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MkDocs</a> solutions for customer review.  We‚Äôll be reviewing at least the core offering (there is a <em>lot</em> more under the Heroku umbrella) at MotM-13 with some discussion and application demos.  At <a href="/2018/05/01/motm-12/" title="MotM-12">MotM-12</a>, we discussed the plans for this upcoming session and mentioned a Modbus simulator as a good demo app to implement and deploy via Heroku.  If you have any other application suggestions (remember, these will be demos! üòÄ) please join us in the discussion over in our <a href="/slack">Slack</a> group or leave a comment below.</p><p>I‚Äôm pretty excited to demonstrate how even the free tier of <a href="https://www.heroku.com" title="Heroku" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heroku</a> can be used to host some great application content.  It isn‚Äôt just about web pages either‚Äìour Modbus simulator will be emulating remote device behavior, and our documentation demo is a great way to host documentation packages.  Combine these with a custom domain name integrations and you can have a pretty broad set of functionality without much hosting upkeep!  I look forward to some wonderful brainstorming on this during next month‚Äôs session.</p><p>If I haven‚Äôt just completely convinced you to drop by yet, don‚Äôt forget that each month we raffle off a free license to one of <strong><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JetBrains‚Äô</a></strong> amazing developer tool offerings!  We‚Äôre very happy to have them as a continuing sponsor of our group.  Come by and take advantage with a chance to leverage their productivity enhancing IDE‚Äôs or refactor/linting tools.</p><center><br><img src="/images/jetbrains.svg" title="JetBrains Logo"><br></center><p>Finally, we‚Äôre looking for more discussion topics for future sessions, so please let us know if you have interest in a particular discussion topic.  I‚Äôve updated our <a href="/mindmap">Mindmap</a> with some more topic ideas‚Äìlet‚Äôs build that list out even more and get some folks lined up to dive in on these!</p><p>That‚Äôs all I have for now.  Enjoy the weather everyone, don‚Äôt forget to go outside and do a little analog processing; all the same, happy coding as well!  üòé</p><p>‚ÄìKevin Collins<br><span class="post-entry-small"><br><em>UPDATE</em>:  As it turned out during preparing materials for this MotM, Heroku is really just for deploying web applications.  It supports WebSockets, but you can‚Äôt deploy an application that listens on an arbitrary TCP socket‚Äìsomething that you need if you‚Äôre going to perform device simulation as my hopes outlined above.  As we discussed during the session, you can have what are called ‚Äúworker‚Äù dynos to perform background tasks, but they won‚Äôt be reachable externally.  Thanks to those who made it out, and we‚Äôre all looking forward to a great rest of 2018, to be continued with a session on ZeroMQ in July!<br></span></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Spring seems to have sprung for the most part üå∑üöú‚ÄìI‚Äôve had to mow my lawn, so I think that counts.  Meeting of the Minds is off to the races for 2018 and we‚Äôve got a great framework to take a look at.  The <a href="https://www.qt.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qt Framework</a> (pronounced ‚Äúcute‚Äù) has grown considerably since the last time I was pseudo-familiar with it.  I remember it from back in the days of the <a href="https://www.gnome.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GNOME</a> vs <a href="https://www.kde.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KDE</a> battles on the Linux Desktop.  GNOME used the GTK+ graphical toolkit, and KDE used Qt.  Taking a peek at things lately yields the realization that a <strong>LOT</strong> has happened since those early days.</p><center><br><img src="/2018/05/01/motm-12/Qt_logo_2016.png"><br></center><p>It‚Äôs all about consistent multi-platform development, across a wide range of use-cases, much more than just single desktop and mobile applications.  Vehicles, refrigerators, automation, and more!  Feel free to check out the <a href="https://www.qt.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qt</a> website for some additional overview content, but what better than some real-world demos, feedback, and discussion?  We‚Äôll be hearing from Alec Weaver, who has been working with the platform to create some interesting applications.  I‚Äôm looking forward to a great session and some great discussions about how Qt might be able to be applied.</p><p>Join us on <strong>Thursday, May 3rd at 6:30pm</strong> in Bonner Springs at <a href="http://thirdspacecoffeehouse.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Third Space Coffee</a>.  Feel free to come by a little beforehand to get a tasty coffee or snack and chat about things tech and otherwise‚Äìthere is a nice deck out back as well to enjoy the nice evening weather.  </p><p>I‚Äôd like to take a moment to give a shout out to our continued sponsor for 2018, <strong><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JetBrains</a></strong>, who has been generous to offer us licenses to their extensive collection of IDE‚Äôs and other tools as offerings in our monthly raffle.  </p><center><br><img src="/images/jetbrains.svg" title="JetBrains Logo"><br></center><p>We‚Äôre always looking for some additional topic ideas, so please feel free to send us a note via our <a href="https://kevincollins3.typeform.com/to/eoGgpP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MotM Topic Submission Form</a>!

We‚Äôre getting close to our next MotM session about <a href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Things Network</a>, which should yield some pretty interesting discussion!  Our presenter this month attended the first <a href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/conference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Things Network Conference</a> in Amsterdam this year and has a lot of great insight into the underlying <a href="https://www.lora-alliance.org/what-is-lora" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LoRaWAN</a> technology driving one of the many waves of the so-called Internet of Things (IoT).</p><img src="/2018/03/31/motm-11/IMG_4204.JPG"><p>I‚Äôm hoping we can build more on some of the great discussions we had during <a href="/2018/02/17/motm-10/" title="MotM-10">MotM-10</a>.  Part of what makes Meeting of the Minds interesting is not just the tech itself but the insights from everyone regarding how it can be applied (and also, sometimes, the why).  LoRaWAN, one of a few emerging Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies, has some unique properties that enable some fascinating possibilities for sensor deployments.  I‚Äôm sure everyone will have some neat ideas to chat about.</p><p>We‚Äôll be meeting again on <strong>Thursday, April 5th at 6:30pm</strong> in Bonner Springs at <a href="http://thirdspacecoffeehouse.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Third Space Coffee</a>.  We‚Äôve reserved the conference room for 6:30pm, but we usually gather before than‚Äìafter all, there is great coffee and tasty bits to be had there.

If you end up working with Python at all, it is difficult to match the features and functionality of their <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PyCharm</a> environment.  They‚Äôve got a bunch of great products, but I couldn‚Äôt help mentioning PyCharm after having it really help me out a lot over the past months.

Vehicles today are more advanced than ever with sophisticated chassis control, automated driving aids, and even more fuel efficient drivetrains.  More and more of the components whose only possibility for improvement depended on turning a wrench or swapping out parts can now be customized through changing some bits in the ever-growing number of computerized controllers that are onboard.</p><p>Alright, alright, so we‚Äôre going to learn how to adjust fuel injection parameters and spark advance curves?  Nope, instead we‚Äôre going to focus on an area of vehicle customization that has been out of reach in times past.  General Motors (and perhaps others) now offers a development SDK for creating custom applications that run on the built-in touchscreen infotainment systems in newer cars.  Best of all, you develop these applications using open technologies such as Node.js! üòé  Check it out on their site for <a href="https://developer.gm.com/ngi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Next Generation Infotainment</a>.</p><p>Join us at <strong>6:30pm</strong> on <strong>March 1st, 2018</strong> in the Conference Room at <a href="http://thirdspacecoffeehouse.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Third Space Coffee House</a> in Bonner Springs, KS.  I‚Äôll be giving a demo of this system along with a proof-of-concept application (source code will be available on our <a href="https://github.com/kctechgroup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a> page afterwards).

Join our <a href="/slack">Slack</a> group (or hop on there if you haven‚Äôt been there in a while) and help us lay out some topics to dive in on in 2018!  We need volunteers for presentations!  You needn‚Äôt be the undisputed expert on a given topic‚Äìwhat we‚Äôre looking for is some time spent putting together an introduction and demonstration so that we can all discover something new and learn a bit about how to get started.</p><p>I also don‚Äôt want to close out 2017 without thanking our sponsor, JetBrains.  Their generous support has enabled us to share some great tools with our community and add some extra incentive for folks to gather and talk technology!

      &lt;p&gt;As the year closes out, I think we all enjoy reflecting a bit on our achievements and accomplishments the past year brought us.  2017 saw, among a great many other things, the introduction of KC Technology Group.  Our trademark-worthy ‚ÄúMeeting of the Minds‚Äù sessions have been a forum for gathering and discussing various technology topics, industry trends, and whatever else may be on, well, our minds.  üòú  I‚Äôve very much enjoyed getting a chance to be introduced to some of the various projects out there in the wild.

&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre taking a brief respite in January, with our next Meeting of the Minds session targeted for &lt;strong&gt;Thursday, February 8th, 2018&lt;/strong&gt;, so lets look back at 2017 and see what we covered‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

MotM-2 will be held on <strong>June 5th, 2017</strong> at <strong>6:30pm</strong> at <a href="http://www.thirdspacecoffeehouse.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Third Space Coffee House</a> in Bonner Springs, KS:</p><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3098.1937755187746!2d-94.88623368430397!3d39.056497979546336!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x87c08ffcb912dbd1%3A0x805559ebce736d95!2s226+Oak+St%2C+Bonner+Springs%2C+KS+66012!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1495064330926" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>This will be our first gathering here, but I can assert that they have great food, exceptional coffee, and a wonderful atmosphere!  The presentation topic, chosen at the last MotM session, will be <strong>Source Control</strong>.  We‚Äôll be covering the basics as well as demoing both Git and Subversion across a few platforms.  We might even offer up a surprise (at least to me!) entry in the Source Control world that I hadn‚Äôt run into before!  In addition to some introductory content, I hope to share a few tips and tricks that will benefit both beginner and advanced users!  </p><p>I‚Äôve got the presentation assembled (at least the Keynote content, you‚Äôll have to come in person to see the demos), feel free to join the presentation live here (although until we work out some additional live video streaming goodness, it might not be that exciting):</p><p><a href="https://www.icloud.com/keynote-live/sc:0Q1HS420lixvG81dldqU97DKkdh1Se2wL_q29M7XiO5VY1ZJQr5Y262Y9cqJOF9vkoR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.icloud.com/keynote-live/sc:0Q1HS420lixvG81dldqU97DKkdh1Se2wL_q29M7XiO5VY1ZJQr5Y262Y9cqJOF9vkoR</a></p><p>Have a great week, and happy coding!</p><p>‚ÄìKevin Collins</p>]]></content>
