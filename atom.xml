<p>Eric Crook (@ecrook on our <a href="/slack">Slack</a> group) has volunteered to give us a presentation on <a href="http://nodered.org" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>Node-RED</strong></a> and shine some light on its capabilities and reveal some of its more common use-cases.  With it being able to run on commodity hardware as well as powerful server-grade machines, everyone can explore <a href="http://nodered.org" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>Node-RED</strong></a> and find their own uses for it.  Feel free to bring your Raspberry Pi and we‚Äôll help get <a href="http://nodered.org" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>Node-RED</strong></a> up and running for you after the presentation!</p>

This session will introduce you to some protocols that you might not have explored yet as well as peeling back the onion on some ones you might not have realized had such potential!  </p>
<p>Returning to <a href="http://www.thirdspacecoffeehouse.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Third Space Coffee House</a> in Bonner Springs on <strong>August 3rd, 2017</strong>, we‚Äôll start the meeting in the conference room at <strong>6:30pm</strong>.  Many folks enjoyed some tasty food before/during <a href="/2017/06/16/motm-3/" title="MotM-3">MotM-3</a>, so feel free to come out and enjoy a bite and/or some delicious coffee ahead of time (they‚Äôll give ya decaf too if you‚Äôd like given the evening schedule ‚òïÔ∏è)!</p>

Jim Evers hasn‚Äôt let us know which product he‚Äôs picked, but I‚Äôm sure there will be one that will enable some pretty neat new code to be constructed!  It is super great to have such generous support from JetBrains</p>

<p>Our last MotM session at Third Space was quite delightful.  There will be food available (they have a wonderful menu!) and possibly some pie too üç∞.  </p>
<p>We‚Äôve still got some work to do on the topic voting‚Äìwe‚Äôre certainly up for volunteers until we land on something concrete!  For this session, we‚Äôre going to fall back on one of my more favorite recent topics.  You guessed it: <strong>Static Site Generators</strong>.  I really think this will be an exciting session‚ÄìI‚Äôll be demoing a few different systems and I‚Äôm expecting a lot of folks to have light bulbs going off!  You‚Äôll be able to do some pretty neat things after this one!</p>
<p>As we get closer, I‚Äôll post a link to some resources for the presentation.  If you haven‚Äôt done it yet, don‚Äôt forget to join us in <a href="/slack">Slack</a>!</p>

<p>This will be our first gathering here, but I can assert that they have great food, exceptional coffee, and a wonderful atmosphere!  The presentation topic, chosen at the last MotM session, will be <strong>Source Control</strong>.  We‚Äôll be covering the basics as well as demoing both Git and Subversion across a few platforms.  We might even offer up a surprise (at least to me!) entry in the Source Control world that I hadn‚Äôt run into before!  In addition to some introductory content, I hope to share a few tips and tricks that will benefit both beginner and advanced users!  </p>
<p>I‚Äôve got the presentation assembled (at least the Keynote content, you‚Äôll have to come in person to see the demos), feel free to join the presentation live here (although until we work out some additional live video streaming goodness, it might not be that exciting):</p>
