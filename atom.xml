    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The growing season has been a little late this year and it feels a bit like we may have skipped Spring straight over to Summer 🔥 here in Kansas, but I think I’m happier with the cold having moved on.  The wind has also calmed itself more lately.  However, since I can’t resist a good pun, the winds of change are still strong at work and that certainly helps us consider new and improved ways of deploying some of our applications!  &lt;– Great segway, yeah?  😆 🤓</p><p>The topic for June’s Meeting of the Minds session is Heroku, and yours truly will be doing the presentation.  I’ve been intrigued by <a href="https://www.heroku.com" title="Heroku">Heroku</a> and its offerings since I became enamoured with container computing more than a year ago.  Lately I’ve actually been putting it to good use deploying some <a href="https://www.mkdocs.org" title="MkDocs">MkDocs</a> solutions for customer review.  We’ll be reviewing at least the core offering (there is a <em>lot</em> more under the Heroku umbrella) at MotM-13 with some discussion and application demos.  At <a href="/MotM/12/" title="MotM-12">MotM-12</a>, we discussed the plans for this upcoming session and mentioned a Modbus simulator as a good demo app to implement and deploy via Heroku.  If you have any other application suggestions (remember, these will be demos! 😀) please join us in the discussion over in our <a href="/slack">Slack</a> group or leave a comment below.</p><p>I’m pretty excited to demonstrate how even the free tier of <a href="https://www.heroku.com" title="Heroku">Heroku</a> can be used to host some great application content.  It isn’t just about web pages either–our Modbus simulator will be emulating remote device behavior, and our documentation demo is a great way to host documentation packages.  Combine these with a custom domain name integrations and you can have a pretty broad set of functionality without much hosting upkeep!  I look forward to some wonderful brainstorming on this during next month’s session.</p><p>If I haven’t just completely convinced you to drop by yet, don’t forget that each month we raffle off a free license to one of <strong><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com">JetBrains’</a></strong> amazing developer tool offerings!  We’re very happy to have them as a continuing sponsor of our group.  Come by and take advantage with a chance to leverage their productivity enhancing IDE’s or refactor/linting tools.</p><center><br><img src="/images/jetbrains.svg" class="" title="JetBrains Logo"><br></center><p>Finally, we’re looking for more discussion topics for future sessions, so please let us know if you have interest in a particular discussion topic.  I’ve updated our <a href="/mindmap">Mindmap</a> with some more topic ideas–let’s build that list out even more and get some folks lined up to dive in on these!</p><p>That’s all I have for now.  Enjoy the weather everyone, don’t forget to go outside and do a little analog processing; all the same, happy coding as well!  😎</p><p>–Kevin Collins<br><span class='post-entry-small'><br><em>UPDATE</em>:  As it turned out during preparing materials for this MotM, Heroku is really just for deploying web applications.  It supports WebSockets, but you can’t deploy an application that listens on an arbitrary TCP socket–something that you need if you’re going to perform device simulation as my hopes outlined above.  As we discussed during the session, you can have what are called “worker” dynos to perform background tasks, but they won’t be reachable externally.  Thanks to those who made it out, and we’re all looking forward to a great rest of 2018, to be continued with a session on ZeroMQ in July!<br></span></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Spring seems to have sprung for the most part 🌷🚜–I’ve had to mow my lawn, so I think that counts.  Meeting of the Minds is off to the races for 2018 and we’ve got a great framework to take a look at.  The <a href="https://www.qt.io">Qt Framework</a> (pronounced “cute”) has grown considerably since the last time I was pseudo-familiar with it.  I remember it from back in the days of the <a href="https://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> vs <a href="https://www.kde.org">KDE</a> battles on the Linux Desktop.  GNOME used the GTK+ graphical toolkit, and KDE used Qt.  Taking a peek at things lately yields the realization that a <strong>LOT</strong> has happened since those early days.</p><center><br><img src="/MotM/12/Qt_logo_2016.png" class=""><br></center><p>It’s all about consistent multi-platform development, across a wide range of use-cases, much more than just single desktop and mobile applications.  Vehicles, refrigerators, automation, and more!  Feel free to check out the <a href="https://www.qt.io">Qt</a> website for some additional overview content, but what better than some real-world demos, feedback, and discussion?  We’ll be hearing from Alec Weaver, who has been working with the platform to create some interesting applications.  I’m looking forward to a great session and some great discussions about how Qt might be able to be applied.</p><p>Join us on <strong>Thursday, May 3rd at 6:30pm</strong> in Bonner Springs at <a href="http://thirdspacecoffeehouse.com">Third Space Coffee</a>.  Feel free to come by a little beforehand to get a tasty coffee or snack and chat about things tech and otherwise–there is a nice deck out back as well to enjoy the nice evening weather.  </p><p>I’d like to take a moment to give a shout out to our continued sponsor for 2018, <strong><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com">JetBrains</a></strong>, who has been generous to offer us licenses to their extensive collection of IDE’s and other tools as offerings in our monthly raffle.  </p><center><br><img src="/images/jetbrains.svg" class="" title="JetBrains Logo"><br></center><p>We’re always looking for some additional topic ideas, so please feel free to send us a note via our <a href="https://kevincollins3.typeform.com/to/eoGgpP">MotM Topic Submission Form</a>!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Though it looks as though we might be in for a chilly Easter, things are generally warming and and we’re starting to see some green on the ground.  We’re getting close to our next MotM session about <a href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org">The Things Network</a>, which should yield some pretty interesting discussion!  Our presenter this month attended the first <a href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/conference/">The Things Network Conference</a> in Amsterdam this year and has a lot of great insight into the underlying <a href="https://www.lora-alliance.org/what-is-lora">LoRaWAN</a> technology driving one of the many waves of the so-called Internet of Things (IoT).</p><img src="/MotM/11/IMG_4204.JPG" class=""><p>I’m hoping we can build more on some of the great discussions we had during <a href="/MotM/10/" title="MotM-10">MotM-10</a>.  Part of what makes Meeting of the Minds interesting is not just the tech itself but the insights from everyone regarding how it can be applied (and also, sometimes, the why).  LoRaWAN, one of a few emerging Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies, has some unique properties that enable some fascinating possibilities for sensor deployments.  I’m sure everyone will have some neat ideas to chat about.</p><p>We’ll be meeting again on <strong>Thursday, April 5th at 6:30pm</strong> in Bonner Springs at <a href="http://thirdspacecoffeehouse.com">Third Space Coffee</a>.  We’ve reserved the conference room for 6:30pm, but we usually gather before than–after all, there is great coffee and tasty bits to be had there.  Come a little earlier to get things going even sooner!</p><center><br><img src="/images/jetbrains.svg" class="" title="JetBrains Logo"><br></center><p>In 2018, we’re continuing to raffle off a license to one of <strong><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com">JetBrains’</a></strong> wonderful IDE’s.  If you end up working with Python at all, it is difficult to match the features and functionality of their <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> environment.  They’ve got a bunch of great products, but I couldn’t help mentioning PyCharm after having it really help me out a lot over the past months.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’re back in the swing of things for 2018, looking forward to Spring! 🌱 🌷  Since we’re not quite there yet, I’ll try and keep your mind busy with the next Meeting of the Minds topic for March!  Vehicles today are more advanced than ever with sophisticated chassis control, automated driving aids, and even more fuel efficient drivetrains.  More and more of the components whose only possibility for improvement depended on turning a wrench or swapping out parts can now be customized through changing some bits in the ever-growing number of computerized controllers that are onboard.</p><p>Alright, alright, so we’re going to learn how to adjust fuel injection parameters and spark advance curves?  Nope, instead we’re going to focus on an area of vehicle customization that has been out of reach in times past.  General Motors (and perhaps others) now offers a development SDK for creating custom applications that run on the built-in touchscreen infotainment systems in newer cars.  Best of all, you develop these applications using open technologies such as Node.js! 😎  Check it out on their site for <a href="https://developer.gm.com/ngi">Next Generation Infotainment</a>.</p><p>Join us at <strong>6:30pm</strong> on <strong>March 1st, 2018</strong> in the Conference Room at <a href="http://thirdspacecoffeehouse.com">Third Space Coffee House</a> in Bonner Springs, KS.  I’ll be giving a demo of this system along with a proof-of-concept application (source code will be available on our <a href="https://github.com/kctechgroup">Github</a> page afterwards).  It should be an entertaining (that part is on me) presentation and discussion (this part is partially on all of you), so come and join the fun!</p><center><br><img src="/images/jetbrains.svg" class="" title="JetBrains Logo"><br></center><p>We’re also back in action with our sponsor for Meeting of the Minds, <strong><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com">JetBrains s.r.o.</a></strong>.  We have a drawing each session for a free license to one of their great IDE’s or development tools.

Kicking off the meeting, everyone gets a chance to briefly mention something that has caught there attention recently.  We’ve got some interesting hits so far and are looking forward to continuing this in 2018 with some better capture and follow-up on the website!  Let’s take a look at what we’ve covered so far:</p><h2 id="2017-Pass-the-Mic"><a href="#2017-Pass-the-Mic" class="headerlink" title="2017 Pass the Mic"></a>2017 Pass the Mic</h2><ul><li>Informational Dashboard Design 📱 - (link to Stephen Few’s website <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/library.php#Books">here</a>)</li><li>Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrency 💰</li><li>Sensor Clouds and Wide-Area Radio Networks ☁️</li><li>Wonderware OI Gateway and MQTT Support 🔗</li><li>Windows (Server 2016 and Windows 10) Container Support <i class="fa fa-archive"></i></li></ul><p>I think 2018 will be another exciting year.  More and more interesting technologies continue to emerge, even more existine ones continue to mature and see increased popularity.  One of the things I love about this group is that we can collectively discover and shed light on more of these fascinating developments that we might not have time for on our own.  Join our <a href="/slack">Slack</a> group (or hop on there if you haven’t been there in a while) and help us lay out some topics to dive in on in 2018!  We need volunteers for presentations!  You needn’t be the undisputed expert on a given topic–what we’re looking for is some time spent putting together an introduction and demonstration so that we can all discover something new and learn a bit about how to get started.</p><p>I also don’t want to close out 2017 without thanking our sponsor, JetBrains.  Their generous support has enabled us to share some great tools with our community and add some extra incentive for folks to gather and talk technology!  Thank you so much JetBrains for all you do and your wonderful support of KC Tech Group.  Let’s give them a hand (👏)and check out some of their great products via the link below!</p><center><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com"><br><img src="/images/jetbrains.svg" class="" title="JetBrains Logo"><br></a></center><p>We’ll plan to see everyone in <strong>February</strong>–let’s have a great 2018 full of discovery, learning, and community.</p><p>Happy Coding.  💻 😎 🖖</p><p>–Kevin Collins</p>]]></content>

We’ll also be touching on regular expressions, which have been around for a long time, but are worth looking at while you’re playing with your new text editor.  😎</p><p>Mike Wickersheim and I will be teaming up on a double header to deliver a presentation on modern <strong>Text Editor</strong> options and the power of <strong>Regular Expressions</strong> along with a summary of the <strong>Ignition Community Conference 2017</strong> last month!

MotM-2 will be held on <strong>June 5th, 2017</strong> at <strong>6:30pm</strong> at <a href="http://www.thirdspacecoffeehouse.com">Third Space Coffee House</a> in Bonner Springs, KS:</p><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3098.1937755187746!2d-94.88623368430397!3d39.056497979546336!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x87c08ffcb912dbd1%3A0x805559ebce736d95!2s226+Oak+St%2C+Bonner+Springs%2C+KS+66012!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1495064330926" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>This will be our first gathering here, but I can assert that they have great food, exceptional coffee, and a wonderful atmosphere!  The presentation topic, chosen at the last MotM session, will be <strong>Source Control</strong>.  We’ll be covering the basics as well as demoing both Git and Subversion across a few platforms.  We might even offer up a surprise (at least to me!) entry in the Source Control world that I hadn’t run into before!  In addition to some introductory content, I hope to share a few tips and tricks that will benefit both beginner and advanced users!  </p><p>I’ve got the presentation assembled (at least the Keynote content, you’ll have to come in person to see the demos), feel free to join the presentation live here (although until we work out some additional live video streaming goodness, it might not be that exciting):</p><p><a href="https://www.icloud.com/keynote-live/sc:0Q1HS420lixvG81dldqU97DKkdh1Se2wL_q29M7XiO5VY1ZJQr5Y262Y9cqJOF9vkoR">https://www.icloud.com/keynote-live/sc:0Q1HS420lixvG81dldqU97DKkdh1Se2wL_q29M7XiO5VY1ZJQr5Y262Y9cqJOF9vkoR</a></p><p>Have a great week, and happy coding!</p><p>–Kevin Collins</p>]]></content>
