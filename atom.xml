Change is one of those things that can sometimes be scary, but many times, we find ourselves in a much better place after conquering that initial resistence and learning something new.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of movement in the world of text editors in recent times, and MotM-7 is ready to share some of the changes with you.  We’ll also be touching on regular expressions, which have been around for a long time, but are worth looking at while you’re playing with your new text editor.  😎</p>
<p>Mike Wickersheim and I will be teaming up on a double header to deliver a presentation on modern <strong>Text Editor</strong> options and the power of <strong>Regular Expressions</strong> along with a summary of the <strong>Ignition Community Conference 2017</strong> last month!  Join us and talk tech at <strong>6:30pm</strong> on <strong>November 2nd, 2017</strong> at <a href="http://thirdspacecoffeehouse.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Third Space Coffee House</a> in Bonner Springs, KS (directions are on their website).  They’ve been offering some pretty amazing soups recently, so come early to endulge (and leverage a tasty cup of coffee to stay awake during our sure-to-be-exhilerating presentation 😉).</p>

<p>I’d like to thank <strong><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com" target="_blank" rel="external">JetBrains s.r.o.</a></strong> for their continued support of KC Tech Group!  I hope to have some of our members reflect in one of the next meetings on some of the projects they’re working on with the JetBrains tools.  We’re going to be raffling off a license to one of JetBrains’ <strong>incredible</strong> IDEs/development tools at MotM-7!  Check out their site for some of their other community offerings, they’ve got some great ways to get started with some great new technologies.</p>

<p>It is an exciting time in this area, as we see a lot of different products and strategies emerge.  I think this is an area that will see a lot more attention in the next couple of years.  I’m not sure how any one of us can keep up on all of it ourselves–this is when we need to engage our community.  Join ours and talk tech with us at <strong>6:30pm</strong> on <strong>October 5th, 2017</strong> at <a href="http://thirdspacecoffeehouse.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Third Space Coffee House</a> in Bonner Springs, KS (directions are on their website).

One such great thing is <a href="http://nodered.org" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>Node-RED</strong></a>, which happens to be the topic of Meeting of the Minds #5!  We’ll be covering <a href="http://nodered.org" target="_blank" rel="external">Node-RED</a> which has superb applications for almost everyone.  Automating some of your home automation gadgets, simulating device behaviors, connecting disparate systems, and much more all fall under the capabilities of a <a href="http://nodered.org" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>Node-RED</strong></a> system.</p>
<p>Eric Crook (@ecrook on our <a href="/slack">Slack</a> group) has volunteered to give us a presentation on <a href="http://nodered.org" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>Node-RED</strong></a> and shine some light on its capabilities and reveal some of its more common use-cases.  With it being able to run on commodity hardware as well as powerful server-grade machines, everyone can explore <a href="http://nodered.org" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>Node-RED</strong></a> and find their own uses for it.  Feel free to bring your Raspberry Pi and we’ll help get <a href="http://nodered.org" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>Node-RED</strong></a> up and running for you after the presentation!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s HOT 🔥 here in Kansas!  Thankfully that won’t dissuade hungry minds from gobbling up great information about <strong>Communications Protocols</strong> in Meeting of the Minds #4!  This session will introduce you to some protocols that you might not have explored yet as well as peeling back the onion on some ones you might not have realized had such potential!  </p>
<p>Returning to <a href="http://www.thirdspacecoffeehouse.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Third Space Coffee House</a> in Bonner Springs on <strong>August 3rd, 2017</strong>, we’ll start the meeting in the conference room at <strong>6:30pm</strong>.  Many folks enjoyed some tasty food before/during <a href="/2017/06/16/motm-3/" title="MotM-3">MotM-3</a>, so feel free to come out and enjoy a bite and/or some delicious coffee ahead of time (they’ll give ya decaf too if you’d like given the evening schedule ☕️)!</p>

Jim Evers hasn’t let us know which product he’s picked, but I’m sure there will be one that will enable some pretty neat new code to be constructed!  It is super great to have such generous support from JetBrains</p>

<p>Our last MotM session at Third Space was quite delightful.  There will be food available (they have a wonderful menu!) and possibly some pie too 🍰.  </p>
<p>We’ve still got some work to do on the topic voting–we’re certainly up for volunteers until we land on something concrete!  For this session, we’re going to fall back on one of my more favorite recent topics.  You guessed it: <strong>Static Site Generators</strong>.  I really think this will be an exciting session–I’ll be demoing a few different systems and I’m expecting a lot of folks to have light bulbs going off!  You’ll be able to do some pretty neat things after this one!</p>
<p>As we get closer, I’ll post a link to some resources for the presentation.  If you haven’t done it yet, don’t forget to join us in <a href="/slack">Slack</a>!</p>

<p>This will be our first gathering here, but I can assert that they have great food, exceptional coffee, and a wonderful atmosphere!  The presentation topic, chosen at the last MotM session, will be <strong>Source Control</strong>.  We’ll be covering the basics as well as demoing both Git and Subversion across a few platforms.  We might even offer up a surprise (at least to me!) entry in the Source Control world that I hadn’t run into before!  In addition to some introductory content, I hope to share a few tips and tricks that will benefit both beginner and advanced users!  </p>
<p>I’ve got the presentation assembled (at least the Keynote content, you’ll have to come in person to see the demos), feel free to join the presentation live here (although until we work out some additional live video streaming goodness, it might not be that exciting):</p>
