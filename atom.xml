<p>Our last MotM session at Third Space was quite delightful.  There will be food available (they have a wonderful menu!) and possibly some pie too üç∞.  </p>
<p>We‚Äôve still got some work to do on the topic voting‚Äìwe‚Äôre certainly up for volunteers until we land on something concrete!  For this session, we‚Äôre going to fall back on one of my more favorite recent topics.  You guessed it: <strong>Static Site Generators</strong>.  I really think this will be an exciting session‚ÄìI‚Äôll be demoing a few different systems and I‚Äôm expecting a lot of folks to have light bulbs going off!  You‚Äôll be able to do some pretty neat things after this one!</p>

<p>As we get closer, I‚Äôll post a link to some resources for the presentation.  If you haven‚Äôt done it yet, don‚Äôt forget to join us in <a href="/slack">Slack</a>!</p>
<p>Happy coding! üòé</p>

<p>This will be our first gathering here, but I can assert that they have great food, exceptional coffee, and a wonderful atmosphere!  The presentation topic, chosen at the last MotM session, will be <strong>Source Control</strong>.  We‚Äôll be covering the basics as well as demoing both Git and Subversion across a few platforms.  We might even offer up a surprise (at least to me!) entry in the Source Control world that I hadn‚Äôt run into before!  In addition to some introductory content, I hope to share a few tips and tricks that will benefit both beginner and advanced users!  </p>
<p>I‚Äôve got the presentation assembled (at least the Keynote content, you‚Äôll have to come in person to see the demos), feel free to join the presentation live here (although until we work out some additional live video streaming goodness, it might not be that exciting):</p>
