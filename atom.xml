    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As the year closes out, I think we all enjoy reflecting a bit on our achievements and accomplishments the past year brought us.  2017 saw, among a great many other things, the introduction of KC Technology Group.  Our trademark-worthy “Meeting of the Minds” sessions have been a forum for gathering and discussing various technology topics, industry trends, and whatever else may be on, well, our minds.  😜  I’ve very much enjoyed getting a chance to be introduced to some of the various projects out there in the wild.  It has also been great to hear about topics that everyone is passionate about.</p>
<p>We’re taking a brief respite in January, with our next Meeting of the Minds session targeted for <strong>Thursday, February 8th, 2018</strong>, so lets look back at 2017 and see what we covered…</p>

</ul>
<p>We also began, at <a href="/2017/10/15/motm-7/" title="MotM-7">MotM-7</a>, a new intro series called “Pass the Mic”.  Kicking off the meeting, everyone gets a chance to briefly mention something that has caught there attention recently.  We’ve got some interesting hits so far and are looking forward to continuing this in 2018 with some better capture and follow-up on the website!  Let’s take a look at what we’ve covered so far:</p>
<h2 id="2017-Pass-the-Mic"><a href="#2017-Pass-the-Mic" class="headerlink" title="2017 Pass the Mic"></a>2017 Pass the Mic</h2><ul>
<li>Informational Dashboard Design 📱 - (link to Stephen Few’s website <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/library.php#Books" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>)</li>
<li>Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrency 💰</li>
<li>Sensor Clouds and Wide-Area Radio Networks ☁️</li>
<li>Wonderware OI Gateway and MQTT Support 🔗</li>
<li>Windows (Server 2016 and Windows 10) Container Support <i class="fa fa-archive"></i></li>
</ul>
<p>I think 2018 will be another exciting year.  More and more interesting technologies continue to emerge, even more existine ones continue to mature and see increased popularity.  One of the things I love about this group is that we can collectively discover and shed light on more of these fascinating developments that we might not have time for on our own.  Join our <a href="/slack">Slack</a> group (or hop on there if you haven’t been there in a while) and help us lay out some topics to dive in on in 2018!  We need volunteers for presentations!  You needn’t be the undisputed expert on a given topic–what we’re looking for is some time spent putting together an introduction and demonstration so that we can all discover something new and learn a bit about how to get started.</p>
<p>I also don’t want to close out 2017 without thanking our sponsor, JetBrains.  Their generous support has enabled us to share some great tools with our community and add some extra incentive for folks to gather and talk technology!  Thank you so much JetBrains for all you do and your wonderful support of KC Tech Group.  Let’s give them a hand (👏)and check out some of their great products via the link below!</p>
<center><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br><img src="/images/jetbrains.svg" title="JetBrains Logo"><br></a></center>

<p>We’ll plan to see everyone in <strong>February</strong>–let’s have a great 2018 full of discovery, learning, and community.</p>
<p>Happy Coding.  💻 😎 🖖</p>

<img src="/2017/11/27/motm-8/IMG_5499.jpg">
<p>For MotM-8, we’ll continue discovering (together!) some of the latest and greatest trends in computing and automation.  We’ve got a sneak peak at Hilscher’s <a href="https://www.netiot.com/netpi/netpi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NetPi</a> platform as well as an introduction to some of the technologies it is using.  We’ve covered <a href="https://www.nodered.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Node-RED</a> in the past (<a href="/2017/08/17/motm-5/" title="MotM-5">MotM-5</a>), and this time around I’ll be giving an introduction to Docker and container technology.  Sure, you can go through the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getting Started</a> guide on Docker’s website, but why not enjoy some tasty coffee and dinner at <a href="http://thirdspacecoffeehouse.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Third Space Coffee House</a> in Bonner Springs, KS (directions are on their website) while I help distill it down!  We’re getting started with the official stuff at <strong>6:30pm</strong> on <strong>Thursday, December 7th, 2017</strong>, but feel free to come early for food and conversation!</p>

I hope to have some of our members reflect in one of the next meetings on some of the projects they’re working on with the JetBrains tools.  We’re going to be raffling off a license to one of JetBrains’ <strong>incredible</strong> IDEs/development tools at MotM-8!  Check out their site for some of their other community offerings, they’ve got some great ways to get started with some great new technologies.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>🎃 As we get ready for Halloween, we sometimes reflect on things that are scary or frightening.  Change is one of those things that can sometimes be scary, but many times, we find ourselves in a much better place after conquering that initial resistence and learning something new.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of movement in the world of text editors in recent times, and MotM-7 is ready to share some of the changes with you.  We’ll also be touching on regular expressions, which have been around for a long time, but are worth looking at while you’re playing with your new text editor.  😎</p>
<p>Mike Wickersheim and I will be teaming up on a double header to deliver a presentation on modern <strong>Text Editor</strong> options and the power of <strong>Regular Expressions</strong> along with a summary of the <strong>Ignition Community Conference 2017</strong> last month!  Join us and talk tech at <strong>6:30pm</strong> on <strong>Thursday, November 2nd, 2017</strong> at <a href="http://thirdspacecoffeehouse.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Third Space Coffee House</a> in Bonner Springs, KS (directions are on their website).  They’ve been offering some pretty amazing soups recently, so come early to endulge (and leverage a tasty cup of coffee to stay awake during our sure-to-be-exhilerating presentation 😉).</p>

This product is a free and open way to integrate some of the smart devices out there in the marketplace, and Alec has some great demos lined up to help get you started!</p>
<p>It is an exciting time in this area, as we see a lot of different products and strategies emerge.  I think this is an area that will see a lot more attention in the next couple of years.  I’m not sure how any one of us can keep up on all of it ourselves–this is when we need to engage our community.

One such great thing is <a href="http://nodered.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Node-RED</strong></a>, which happens to be the topic of Meeting of the Minds #5!  We’ll be covering <a href="http://nodered.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Node-RED</a> which has superb applications for almost everyone.  Automating some of your home automation gadgets, simulating device behaviors, connecting disparate systems, and much more all fall under the capabilities of a <a href="http://nodered.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Node-RED</strong></a> system.</p>
<p>Eric Crook (@ecrook on our <a href="/slack">Slack</a> group) has volunteered to give us a presentation on <a href="http://nodered.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Node-RED</strong></a> and shine some light on its capabilities and reveal some of its more common use-cases.  With it being able to run on commodity hardware as well as powerful server-grade machines, everyone can explore <a href="http://nodered.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Node-RED</strong></a> and find their own uses for it.  Feel free to bring your Raspberry Pi and we’ll help get <a href="http://nodered.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Node-RED</strong></a> up and running for you after the presentation!</p>

<p>Our last MotM session at Third Space was quite delightful.  There will be food available (they have a wonderful menu!) and possibly some pie too 🍰.  </p>
<p>We’ve still got some work to do on the topic voting–we’re certainly up for volunteers until we land on something concrete!  For this session, we’re going to fall back on one of my more favorite recent topics.  You guessed it: <strong>Static Site Generators</strong>.  I really think this will be an exciting session–I’ll be demoing a few different systems and I’m expecting a lot of folks to have light bulbs going off!  You’ll be able to do some pretty neat things after this one!</p>
<p>As we get closer, I’ll post a link to some resources for the presentation.  If you haven’t done it yet, don’t forget to join us in <a href="/slack">Slack</a>!</p>

MotM-2 will be held on <strong>June 5th, 2017</strong> at <strong>6:30pm</strong> at <a href="http://www.thirdspacecoffeehouse.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Third Space Coffee House</a> in Bonner Springs, KS:</p>

<p>This will be our first gathering here, but I can assert that they have great food, exceptional coffee, and a wonderful atmosphere!  The presentation topic, chosen at the last MotM session, will be <strong>Source Control</strong>.  We’ll be covering the basics as well as demoing both Git and Subversion across a few platforms.  We might even offer up a surprise (at least to me!) entry in the Source Control world that I hadn’t run into before!  In addition to some introductory content, I hope to share a few tips and tricks that will benefit both beginner and advanced users!  </p>
<p>I’ve got the presentation assembled (at least the Keynote content, you’ll have to come in person to see the demos), feel free to join the presentation live here (although until we work out some additional live video streaming goodness, it might not be that exciting):</p>
