One challenge that all tech enthusiasts face is how to keep track of our thoughts.  With so many new and upcoming technologies, combined with continual revisions to the ones we use everyday, it can be a challenge.

Simple outlines can sometimes do the trick, but how can we leverage more of the visual side of our brain?  [Mind Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) are one way to grow past basic text-based gatherings of thoughts and lay out our ideas in a way that works!

For KC Tech Group, we maintain a mind map with some of our latest thoughts.  Check out our latest below (built using [MindNode](https://mindnode.com)):
