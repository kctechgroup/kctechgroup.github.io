The Kansas City Technology Group was founded out of a desire to combine a passion for tech hardware and software with a community based social group to drive discussions and collaboration.

The mission of this group is to ensure that we engage each other to learn and grow, all while having a great time!  We're all tech enthusiasts, and we welcome others who share the desire to create new things and cultivate new ideas.

Join us on [Slack](https://kctechgroup.slack.com) and attend the next Meeting of the Minds (MotM) session, held monthly!
