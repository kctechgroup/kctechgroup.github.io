It has been a while since we've updated our website, so I thought I'd post a little something here..  As you might imagine, COVID-19 definitely put a damper on our ability to hold meetups.  Prior to that whole mess, we were also having some trouble finding good locations to resume our sessions.  Hopefully we'll be able to rejuvenate our Meeting of the Minds sessions later in 2021.

Keep safe out there and Happy Coding!
