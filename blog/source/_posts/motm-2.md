This will be our first gathering here, but I can assert that they have great food, exceptional coffee, and a wonderful atmosphere!  The presentation topic, chosen at the last MotM session, will be **Source Control**.  We'll be covering the basics as well as demoing both Git and Subversion across a few platforms.  In addition to some introductory content, I hope to share a few tips and tricks that will benefit both beginner and advanced users!  

Check back for a post here with some summary points as we get closer to June 5th.

Have a great week, and happy coding!
