This will be our first gathering here, but I can assert that they have great food, exceptional coffee, and a wonderful atmosphere!  The presentation topic, chosen at the last MotM session, will be **Source Control**.  We'll be covering the basics as well as demoing both Git and Subversion across a few platforms.  We might even offer up a surprise (at least to me!) entry in the Source Control world that I hadn't run into before!  In addition to some introductory content, I hope to share a few tips and tricks that will benefit both beginner and advanced users!  

I've got the presentation assembled (at least the Keynote content, you'll have to come in person to see the demos), feel free to join the presentation live here (although until we work out some additional live video streaming goodness, it might not be that exciting):

Have a great week, and happy coding!
