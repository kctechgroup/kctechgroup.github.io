Fall is here! üçÉüçÅüçÇ  We touched on some great points in {% post_link motm-5 MotM-5 %}, but we're pushing that even further with a deeper look at Home Automation, specifically [Home Assistant](http://home-assistant.io) with a presentation by Alec Weaver (@aweaver on our [Slack](/slack) group).  This product is a free and open way to integrate some of the smart devices out there in the marketplace, and Alec has some great demos lined up to help get you started!

<!-- more -->

It is an exciting time in this area, as we see a lot of different products and strategies emerge.  I think this is an area that will see a lot more attention in the next couple of years.  I'm not sure how any one of us can keep up on all of it ourselves--this is when we need to engage our community.  Join ours and talk tech with us at **6:30pm** on **October 5th, 2017** at [Third Space Coffee House](http://thirdspacecoffeehouse.com) in Bonner Springs, KS (directions are on their website).  Come early and get some dinner and _wonderful_ coffee!
