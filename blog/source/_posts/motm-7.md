ðŸŽƒ As we get ready for Halloween, we sometimes reflect on things that are scary or frightening.  Change is one of those things that can sometimes be scary, but many times, we find ourselves in a much better place after conquering that initial resistence and learning something new.

There has been a lot of movement in the world of text editors in recent times, and MotM-7 is ready to share some of the changes with you.  We'll also be touching on regular expressions, which have been around for a long time, but are worth looking at while you're playing with your new text editor.  ðŸ˜Ž

Mike Wickersheim and I will be teaming up on a double header to deliver a presentation on modern __Text Editor__ options and the power of __Regular Expressions__ along with a summary of the __Ignition Community Conference 2017__ last month!  Join us and talk tech at **6:30pm** on **Thursday, November 2nd, 2017** at [Third Space Coffee House](http://thirdspacecoffeehouse.com) in Bonner Springs, KS (directions are on their website).  They've been offering some pretty amazing soups recently, so come early to endulge (and leverage a tasty cup of coffee to stay awake during our sure-to-be-exhilerating presentation ðŸ˜‰).

I'd like to thank **[JetBrains s.r.o.](https://www.jetbrains.com)** for their continued support of KC Tech Group!  I hope to have some of our members reflect in one of the next meetings on some of the projects they're working on with the JetBrains tools.  We're going to be raffling off a license to one of JetBrains' __incredible__ IDEs/development tools at MotM-7!  Check out their site for some of their other community offerings, they've got some great ways to get started with some great new technologies.

Don't forget to join us on our [Slack](/slack) group!  See you in November, happy coding! ðŸ‘»
