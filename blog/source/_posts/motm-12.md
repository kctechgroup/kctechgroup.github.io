Spring seems to have sprung for the most part ðŸŒ·ðŸšœ--I've had to mow my lawn, so I think that counts.  Meeting of the Minds is off to the races for 2018 and we've got a great framework to take a look at.  The [Qt Framework](https://www.qt.io) (pronounced "cute") has grown considerably since the last time I was pseudo-familiar with it.  I remember it from back in the days of the [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org) vs [KDE](https://www.kde.org) battles on the Linux Desktop.  GNOME used the GTK+ graphical toolkit, and KDE used Qt.  Taking a peek at things lately yields the realization that a **LOT** has happened since those early days.

It's all about consistent multi-platform development, across a wide range of use-cases, much more than just single desktop and mobile applications.  Vehicles, refrigerators, automation, and more!  Feel free to check out the [Qt](https://www.qt.io) website for some additional overview content, but what better than some real-world demos, feedback, and discussion?  We'll be hearing from Alec Weaver, who has been working with the platform to create some interesting applications.  I'm looking forward to a great session and some great discussions about how Qt might be able to be applied.

Join us on **Thursday, May 3rd at 6:30pm** in Bonner Springs at [Third Space Coffee](http://thirdspacecoffeehouse.com).  Feel free to come by a little beforehand to get a tasty coffee or snack and chat about things tech and otherwise--there is a nice deck out back as well to enjoy the nice evening weather.  

I'd like to take a moment to give a shout out to our continued sponsor for 2018, **[JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com)**, who has been generous to offer us licenses to their extensive collection of IDE's and other tools as offerings in our monthly raffle.
