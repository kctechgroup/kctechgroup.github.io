We're back for another Meeting of the Minds!  MotM-3 will gather on **July 6th, 2017** at **6:30pm** (feel free to come early to get coffee and food, folks will start arriving around 6pm) at [Third Space Coffee House](http://www.thirdspacecoffeehouse.com) in Bonner Springs, KS.

Our last MotM session at Third Space was quite delightful.  There will be food available (they have a wonderful menu!) and possibly some pie too üç∞.  

We've still got some work to do on the topic voting--we're certainly up for volunteers until we land on something concrete!  For this session, we're going to fall back on one of my more favorite recent topics.  You guessed it: **Static Site Generators**.  I really think this will be an exciting session--I'll be demoing a few different systems and I'm expecting a lot of folks to have light bulbs going off!  You'll be able to do some pretty neat things after this one!

<!-- more -->

As we get closer, I'll post a link to some resources for the presentation.  If you haven't done it yet, don't forget to join us in [Slack](/slack)!

Happy coding! üòé
