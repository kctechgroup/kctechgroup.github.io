### <div style="color: #E43D4F;">_Rescheduled to September 6th!_</div>

For MotM #15, we've got something special planned!  Unfortunately, we need a bit more time to put it all together.  Instead of the normal presentation on a given topic, we'd like to invite folks to come and have a go at one or more of the technologies that we've covered over the past year.  This could mean that you have a go at implementing ZeroMQ, or you finally get around to running through that Python tutorial you were looking at.  Whatever it may be, join us for a fun time!

We're working on getting some laptops provisioned for folks to use as well, so if you don't have a machine to use we can help you out.  _Stay tuned for more details and information!_

Another mention on the **[JetBrains][]** front: **PyCharm 2018.2** was released recently with support for _Pipenv_ and a lot more!  Read more on their [What's New](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/whatsnew/) page!  We've been blessed to have JetBrains as a continued sponsor for KC Tech Group--we thank them for their support.  We're also pretty excited about their latest releases!

Anybody who is interested in diving into some Python during our Hackathon in September can definitely dip their toes into [PyCharm][] at the same time.  I'll be there proclaiming its wonder.  ðŸ˜€

Have a great rest of the summer, and we'll see you in September!  Happy Coding!
